Science requires transparency. When scientific theory or methods guides a democratic government, does the work of research design and data analysis require *more* transparency? If democratic theory seems to suggest that science-in-government ought to face higher transparency and openness standards than science-in-academia, how should we protect individuals? In this paper, we describe what we see as the special burdens of social and behavioral scientists working in government (especially focusing on those using theory from psychology and economics to attempt to change citizen behavior) *and* grapple with the questions about individual rights. We use examples from our own work on the White House Social and Behavioral Science Team of the USA to help make concrete our arguments.
