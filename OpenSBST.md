# Why this document?

A growing number of governments believe that social and behavioral scientists can help them improve their work. For example, on in September of 2015 President Barak Obama referred to the work of the new White House Social and Behavioral Sciences team when he issued Executive Order 13707 "Using Behavioral Insights To Better Serve the American People" saying:

> A growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights --- research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them --- can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people.

>Where Federal policies have been designed to reflect behavioral science insights, they have substantially improved outcomes for the individuals, families, communities, and businesses those policies serve. For example, automatic enrollment and automatic escalation in retirement savings plans have made it easier to save for the future, and have helped Americans accumulate billions of dollars in additional retirement savings. Similarly, streamlining the application process for Federal financial aid has made college more financially accessible for millions of students.

Behavioral insights groups containing people with training in psychology, economics, political science, sociology and public policy have been recently founded at the national level in the UK, Germany, Australia, at the United Nations, and in the city of Washington, DC (and probably other places).

How should scientists working to improve government act? We have a good sense for how scientists should act in general. In general, science helps us solve problems and answer questions via impersonal and asynchronous collaboration: the idea is that each individual scientist is ignorant, but that groups of scientists, working across time, space, language, and technique, will gradually improve what we know. This idea, that no single person ought to have authority can be seen in Richard Feynman's 1955 address to the National Academy of Arts and Sciences:

> "I would now like to turn to a third value that science has. It is a little less direct, but not much. The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty --- some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain.

> Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question --- to doubt --- to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. Herein lies a responsibility to society. (Feynman 1955, page 4--5)

We also see this idea in the very recent discussions about open science, for example the idea that scientific claims should be available to be evaluated broadly and with minimal barriers:

> "Trust is not a scientific value.  Transparency is a replacement for trust.  The irrelevance of trust is facilitated by having no central authority for truth, and by making evidence and its source available publicly.  In principle, anyone can evaluate the basis of claims, and reproduce the procedures in order to verify the claims." (Center for Open Science: Strategic Plan, page 5)

Many behavioral insights groups work within governments that adhere to the general principles of open government. The principles of open government are collaboration, participation, transparency.^[<http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration> ].  The principles of open science are integrity, reproducibility, and openness.^[ See for example some of the resources linked on Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science> and <http://sciencecommons.org/resources/readingroom/principles-for-open-science/> and see <http://book.openingscience.org/basics_background/open_science_one_term_five_schools_of_thought.html>.] Open government is supposed to be more resilient, efficient and legitimate than a government which discourages involvement from its people.^[Avoiding the word 'citizen' here because governments serve many people who are not citizens, both inside and outside of their sovereign territories.]

In this document, I suggest that we build a workflow for behavioral and social science within government remembering that science requires doubting and uncertain individuals collaborating across time and space with minimal barriers. I think that this workflow differs from the open science workflow because the purpose of the work within governments is not mainly to advance science but to serve the government and the people.

Eventually, I hope that a future version of this document can help guide choices of the growing number of social and behavioral scientists working to improve government at all levels. For now, this is an idiosyncratic draft begging for constructive input.

## Practice Humility


### Articulate more than one approach to any question

Most of the behavioral insights teams are supposed to bring expertise into government. If you are on one of those teams people will say, "As an expert, given your extensive knowledge of a vast field of rigorous study, what should we do to accomplish this here policy goal / improve this practice?" Now, as a scientist comfortable with doubt and ignorance, who understands that "shared understanding" or "scientific consensus" does not mean "truth", if you are working in the government you cannot always answer such questions with "I don't know." What you can do, however, is explain in plain language, what you think the government can learn from past studies, what you think the scientific consensus is, what some options might be given what you have read and considered.

What has the agency been doing already to improve processes or confront problems? Can you imagine small improvements based on what they are already doing? The people in the agency tend to know a lot more than you about how to do their work and often have hit on very good ideas that only require a little help from you to re-articulate or motivate.

### Make sure 

## Practice Socialability

Working in the open can mean typing memoranda or research designs or data analysis code in public GitHub repositories using plain text.^[GitHub itself is not 100% open source, but it is free for public repositories and so far, is the best tool for working in the open that we've seen. "Work in the open" comes from <https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/31/working-in-public-from-day-1/>.] It might also mean publishing results and interpretation of those results on a website, a blog, or in open access scientific journals where citizens outside of academia can learn about the work after it is done.

Wherever possible we should work in the open. Agency partners, the people they serve, and others around the world, should be able to see our process. What are the virtues of this way of work?

### Virtue 1: Enable Citizen Science to increase quality quickly and build trust.

We want to enable citizen science because we have seen how openness
improves quality quickly within open source projects (cite) and because we
believe that citizens involved in citizen science come to see government
as a force for good (even if an often frustrating and slow force for
good). Citizens have paid us to do this work by making the work accessible to the public we are showing came of their investment.

### Virtue 2: Open work speeds learning (by others from us and us from others)

We want to increase the ability of people in government agencies to use
insights and methods from the behavioral and social sciences to improve their
policy outcomes. Openness enables others to learn from us: if we make our
memos, reports, research designs and code public, then others can more easily follow
our example (and, as we noted above, if we use the right tools and nurture the
right norms, then others can more easily improve our examples).

### Reduce barriers to learning

Because of our mission to expand the ability of others to do what we do,
we want to avoid barriers to adoption of our ways or working (or
barriers to our ability to learn from constructive criticism). This means
we use open-source, free, multiplatform tools and services whenever
possible.

### Empower Partner Agencies to work in the open.

We do not tend to own the data that emerges from our collaborations with
agencies. So, although we can commit to making our own work open, we
cannot commit on their behalf. That said, we can make it as easy as
possible for them to be maximally open and reap the benefits of
openness. If possible, and ethical, we will share data, including de-identified interviews and user experience research to enable others to go beyond our analyeses. Right now, sharing data with agencies is difficult --- such that our standard practice might involve sending code for them to run on their own machines, or sending a virtual machine image for them to use on their own machines (or even lending a laptop). With other agencies data sharing is easier and we might be able to share simulated versions of the original data (i.e. try to follow best practices in differential privacy as results accumulate)^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy>,  <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859m-s11/www/lectures/lect0420.pdf>] OR we might run our own virtual machine where we can allow people (upon request) to run R code (that we pre-screen).

### Way 2: 

# How to report results?


We might want to include some assessment of the heterogeneity of treatment effects. And/or we might want an assessment about hypotheses about rare and aberrant effects (i.e. if a small number of people might be harmed by the change).

# End Matter

This document builds on the [*commitment of the federal government to
openness*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/open) and especially on my 
interpretation of the detailed [*US Open Government National Action Plan
3.0*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/final_us_open_government_national_action_plan_3_0.pdf)
as it applies to the SBST mission and work. It is also inspired by the ways and virtues of my colleagues in the GSA at [*18F*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/31/working-in-public-from-day-1/)
