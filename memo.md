This document articulates some of the principles that guide our work and elucidates some of the implications of these principles.

# Mission

We aim to improve the way that government serves the people (including the people of the government) by using insights and methods from the behavioral and social sciences.

Our mission requires that we work in ways that engender trust: we have to trust in ourselves and the literatures on which we build enough to make proposals for policy changes and research designs to assess our ideas, our agency partners must trust that we will help them (even if we discover no effects), the people served by the agency must trust us (directly or indirectly) to make their lives better.

To improve the relationship between government and people we have to work in ways that make us trust ourselves and that encourage the trust of our agency partners and the people they serve.


## The Ways

### Work in the open

Wherever possible we should work in the open. Agency partners, the people they serve, and others around the world, should be able to see our process.

## The Virtues


### Work in the open




### Enable Citizen Science

We want to enable citizen science because we have seen how openness
improves quality quickly within open source projects and because we
believe that citizens involved in citizen science come to see government
as a force for good (even if an often frustrating and slow force for
good). We also have a pedagogical mission: we want to increase the
ability of people in government agencies to use insights and methods
from the behavioral and social sciences to improve their policy
outcomes. Openness enables others to learn from us: if we make our
research designs and analysis code public, then others can more easily
follow our example (and, as we noted above, if we use the right tools
and nurture the right norms, then others can more easily improve our
examples).

Because of our mission to expand the ability of others to do what we do,
we want to avoid barriers to adoption of our ways or working (or
barriers to our ability to learn from constructive criticism). This means
we use open-source, free, multiplatform tools and services whenever
possible.

We do not tend to own the data that emerges from our collaborations with
agencies. So, although we can commit to making our own work open, we
cannot commit on their behalf. That said, we can make it as easy as
possible for them to be maximally open and reap the benefits of
openness.



This document builds on the [*commitment of the federal government to
openness*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/open) and especially on our
interpretation of the detailed [*US Open Government National Action Plan
3.0*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/final_us_open_government_national_action_plan_3_0.pdf)
as it applies to our mission and work.
