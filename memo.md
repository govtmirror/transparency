This document articulates some of the principles that guide our work and elucidates some of the implications of these principles. Right now, we aspire to work in the way described here.

# Mission

We aim to improve the way that government serves the people (including the
people of the government) by using insights and methods from the behavioral and
social sciences.

We hope to work as a force for good directly by working with agency partners to
propose policy changes and assessing whether those changes did, in fact, change
the world for the better.  We also hope to develop the ability and desire to
use theory, findings, and method from behavioral and social sciences among
people who have pursued civil service as a profession instead of the behavioral
and social sciences. That is, we have a mission to build capacity even as we
have a mission to design and evaluate policy changes ourselves. In fact, we,
ourselves, have no authority to implement changes in the ways in which agencies
serve the public, nor do we have authority to collect data on the outcomes of
these changes. It is only working together with agencies that we can do our
job: so, building capacity is as central a concern as reporting on how the
behavioral and social sciences improved the lives of Americans.

Our mission requires that we work in ways that engender trust: we have to trust
in ourselves and the literatures on which we build enough to make proposals for
policy changes and research designs to assess our ideas, our agency partners
must trust that we will help them (even if we discover no effects, even if no
past scientific literature provides guidance), the people served by the agency
must trust us (directly or indirectly through the agency) to make their lives
better.

Trust in ourselves requires that we work in a collaborative yet asynchronous
fashion: we have to be able to collaborate with our future selves as well as
with others. Trust in us from agency partners and their populations requires
openness about what we do and why we do it.

These basic requirements for our work lead to a series of operational
commitments or prioritized ways of working.

## The Ways and Virtues

### Work in the open

Working in the open can mean typing memoranda or research designs or data analysis code in public GitHub repositories using plain text.^[GitHub itself is not 100% open source, but it is free for public repositories and so far, is the best tool for working in the open that we've seen.] It might also mean publishing our work in scientific journals.

Wherever possible we should work in the open. Agency partners, the people they serve, and others around the world, should be able to see our process. What are the virtues of this way of work?

### Virtue 1: Enable Citizen Science to increase quality quickly and build trust.

We want to enable citizen science because we have seen how openness
improves quality quickly within open source projects (cite) and because we
believe that citizens involved in citizen science come to see government
as a force for good (even if an often frustrating and slow force for
good).

### Virtue 2: Open work speeds learning (by others from us and us from others)

We want to increase the ability of people in government agencies to use
insights and methods from the behavioral and social sciences to improve their
policy outcomes. Openness enables others to learn from us: if we make our
memos, reports, research designs and code public, then others can more easily follow
our example (and, as we noted above, if we use the right tools and nurture the
right norms, then others can more easily improve our examples).

### Reduce barriers to learning

Because of our mission to expand the ability of others to do what we do,
we want to avoid barriers to adoption of our ways or working (or
barriers to our ability to learn from constructive criticism). This means
we use open-source, free, multiplatform tools and services whenever
possible.

### Empower Partner Agencies to work in the open.

We do not tend to own the data that emerges from our collaborations with
agencies. So, although we can commit to making our own work open, we
cannot commit on their behalf. That said, we can make it as easy as
possible for them to be maximally open and reap the benefits of
openness.


# End Matter

This document builds on the [*commitment of the federal government to
openness*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/open) and especially on our
interpretation of the detailed [*US Open Government National Action Plan
3.0*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/final_us_open_government_national_action_plan_3_0.pdf)
as it applies to our mission and work. It is also inspired by the ways and virtues of our colleagues in the GSA at [*18F*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/31/working-in-public-from-day-1/)
