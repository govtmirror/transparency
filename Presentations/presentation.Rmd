```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
## To compile this by hand do:
## library(rmarkdown)
## render("presentation.Rmd")
## On my system then: 
## pandoc +RTS -K512m -RTS presentation.utf8.md --to beamer --from markdown+autolink_bare_uris+ascii_identifiers+tex_math_single_backslash --output presentation.pdf --template sbst.beamer --table-of-contents --slide-level 2 --highlight-style tango --latex-engine /Library/TeX/texbin/xelatex 

## the 'toc: yes' line above tricks pandoc into running latex twice so that we can see the nice logos

# Some customization.  You can alter or delete as desired (if you know what you are doing).
# knitr settings to control how R chunks work.

require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(
  size = "scriptsize",    # slightly smaller font for code
  echo = TRUE,
  results = 'markup',
  strip.white = TRUE,
  cache = FALSE,
  highlight = TRUE,
  width.cutoff = 60,
  out.width = '.9\\textwidth',
  message = FALSE,
  comment = NA,
  tidy = TRUE,     # display code as typed
  tidy.opts = list(blank = FALSE, width.cutoff = 60))

# Introducing Behavioral Insights Teams

## Behavioral Insights Teams in Government

USA Executive Order 13707 "Using Behavioral Insights To Better Serve the American People":

> A growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights --- research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them --- can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people.

## General Strategies to Enhance Confidence and Reduce Bugs
<!-- HTML presentations use a different color choice method  for example <span style="color:orange">Work together</span> --->


1) \textcolor{orange}{Work together:} 
	- If you and your colleagues are going to have to use each others' code, you may start writing code as if others were going to read it.
	- A second pair of eyes spots errors.

2) \textcolor{orange}{Test assumptions:} Can we get the program to fail when it does something wrong?

3) \textcolor{orange}{Track dependencies:} What file depends on what other file? Can we go from raw data to results in one command? Where did this figure come from?
	- Share files instead of copying files.
	- Think in Batch mode (even if you develop in interactive mode)
	- Plan for use of code on a fresh computer/empty directory.
  
4) Other ideas for after the presentation? 

# Track dependencies: Know how outputs relate to inputs

## Data Sharing Idea 2: Data Online

Other data can be read directly from a website:

## Other Data Sharing Ideas

Small Text Files (.txt,.csv) can live on Github (currently this is all public)

\medskip

Eventually we will have some shared data space on an Amazon EC2 instance.

## Think in Batch Mode

\textcolor{orange}{Ideal:} Go from raw data to numbers, tables, figures in one command starting from a clean slate.

For example, at the command line `R --vanilla --file=masterfile.R` does the whole analysis.
